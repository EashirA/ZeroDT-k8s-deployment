**Project Title:** Zero Downtime Deployments with Blue-Green, Rolling, and Canary Strategies  

Objective

The goal of this project was to design and validate three Kubernetes deployment strategies that ensure **zero downtime** during application updates:
- Blue-Green Deployment  
- Rolling Update  
- Canary Release using Argo Rollouts

A simple versioned web application was containerized and deployed using each strategy to assess upgrade safety and traffic control effectiveness.

Application

A lightweight Python HTTP server was created that serves a static HTML file showing version number:

- `v1` â†’ displays `Version 1`  
- `v2` â†’ displays `Version 2`  

Docker Hub Repository:

Strategy 1 â€“ Blue-Green Deployment

- Two separate deployments: `zero-app-blue` (v1) and `zero-app-green` (v2)
- A single Service (`zero-app-svc`) initially routes to the `v1` deployment
- A manual selector switch (`version: v2`) was applied to transition traffic
- Tested with `curl` to verify zero downtime

Outcome: Smooth traffic cutover with zero downtime

---

Strategy 2 â€“ Rolling Update

- A single deployment (`zero-app-rolling`) was configured with:
  - `maxSurge: 1`
  - `maxUnavailable: 0`
- Updated image from `v1` to `v2` using `kubectl apply`
- Service remained uninterrupted during rollout
- Verified with continuous `curl` monitoring

Outcome: Rolling updates occurred without any service disruption

---

Strategy 3 â€“ Canary Deployment (Argo Rollouts)

- Canary rollout created using `Rollout` resource with these steps:
  - `setWeight: 25`
  - `pause: 20s`
  - `setWeight: 50`
  - `pause: 20s`
  - `setWeight: 100`
- Live monitoring with:
  ```bash
  kubectl argo rollouts get rollout zero-app-rollout --watch
